well, this is a 2nd degree equation solver I created to calculate X's roots of you equation. 
It calculates the roots of the equation using the quadratic formula: \[ x = \frac{{-b \pm \sqrt{{b^2 - 4ac}}}}{{2a}} \] ## Features - Accepts coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` as inputs.
- Calculates both real and complex roots. - Handles cases with: - Two real roots - One real root (repeated) - No real roots (complex roots) - User-friendly command-line interface.
-  ## Installation To use the Quadratic Equation Solver, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
-  ```bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quadratic-equation-solver.git cd quadratic-equation-solver ``` Install any required dependencies (if applicable):
-   ```bash pip install -r requirements.txt ``` ## Usage Run the solver from the command line: ```bash python solver.py ``` You will be prompted to enter the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c`.
-    After inputting the values, the program will display the calculated roots. ## Example ```plaintext Enter coefficient a: 1 Enter coefficient b: -3 Enter coefficient c:
-     2 The roots are: x1 = 2.0, x2 = 1.0 ``` ## Contributing Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
